# Arthritis Net
Automated bone erosion scoring for rheumatoid arthritis with deep convolutional neural networks

## About
In fall 2017 I wrote a project thesis at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, where I examined wheter bone erosion scores of patients with rheumatoid arthritis can be predicted wih deep convolutional neural networks. The networks were trained on cropped x-ray images of left hands. The code in this repository can be used to reproduce the results in the thesis.

The thesis can be found here: [project.pdf](../master/doc/project.pdf)

All jupyter notebooks can be run on the following docker container: [tensorflow:1.4.0-gpu-py3](https://gcr.io/tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.0-gpu-py3)
