\section{Introduction}

This thesis shows a method for the automated scoring of x-ray images of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 

\subsection{Background}

Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by a malfunctioning immune system. It is therefore a type of autoimmune diseases. The immune system attacks healthy tissue instead of bacteria and viruses. This causes inflammation in the joints. Irreversible damage to the bone in the joint can occur, if the inflammation lasts for a long time. \cite{rheuma} Rheumatoid arthritis is incurable, merely the symptoms can be treated.

Today, the severity of the bone erosion is assessed by a trained rheumatologist by using x-ray images of hand and feet. This process takes several minutes per patient. Recent advances in computer vision make it possible to automate this task. This leads to time savings which in return helps the rheumatologist to spend more time with the patient.

The Swiss Clinical Quality Management in Rheumatic Diseases (SCQM) Foundation runs a national registry of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. \cite{scqm_about} They have collected anonymized patient data for over 10 years and provide us with x-ray images for this analysis.

Seantis GmbH is a Swiss company that develops data driven web applications for medical research, pubic administration and aviation. \cite{seantis_about} For their customer SCQM they want to automate the bone erosion assessment. They already have a working algorithm, which detects the body part shown in the x-ray image. A second algorithm detects the joints in the image and extracts them as single images. These images are then used together with the bone erosion scores to train our model.

There are several applications where convolutional neural networks are used in medical research.

A recent paper from Tajbakhsh et al. \cite{tajbakhsh_2017} investigated whether fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN is better than training a CNN from scratch when applied to medical images. They find that pre-trained networks with fine-tuning always outperformed or at least performed as well as CNNs trained from scratch. They further recommend a layer-wise fine tuning which seems to outperform shallow and deep tuning.

A report from Chen \cite{chen_2016} uses convolutional neural networks on x-ray images of hands to predict the developmental bone age. He achieves a top one and two accuracy of 46 \% and 70 \% respectively. This result is close to previously used methods which use manual segmentation and handcrafted features.

\subsection{Aim and scope of this thesis}

The aim of this thesis is to predict bone erosion scores from x-ray images. We further examine how the bone erosion and the disease activity are correlated and use a time series of images to predict the course of the disease.

The work is based on images of the left hand only.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

\subsection{Convolutional neural networks}
\label{subsec:cnn}
Convolutional neural networks take an image as an input. The image then gets passed through several convolutional layers. These layers work as filters and detect different features in the image. The weights of these layers are combined to class scores. Andrey Karpathy provides a good overview over convolutional neural networks in his course notes for the Stanford class CS231n. \cite{cnn}
